Dear Programmer, 

We are in need of assistance for fixing our scoreboard app. There are a great deal of football games this weekend and our customers need our scoreboard app so that they can post on their social media channels during the games. Our programmer just quit this past week because he has taken a job on the West Coast. In addition, we donâ€™t know what any of the code actually does because there was no documentation. 

We are asking for quotes to perform the following:

Figure out what is wrong with the app and fix it.
Allow us to make future updates to the app by documenting the code. 

We will send you a link to the source code on GitHub, you can download from there and go to work.

Bruce Wayne
